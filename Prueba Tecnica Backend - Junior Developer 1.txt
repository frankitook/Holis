Technical Test Backend - Junior Developer
Context: You are part of the backend team at Google responsible for the Google search system. Your task is to develop a functionality that allows searching for keywords within a set of web pages.

Requirements:
You must implement a function in JavaScript that finds the pages containing the keywords requested by a user.

Task Description:
Create a function called searchPages that takes the following parameters:

- query: An array of strings containing the keywords that the user is searching for.

- pages: An array of objects where each object represents a web page, with the following properties:
	 - url: The URL of the web page.
	 - content: A string containing all the text of the page.


const query = ['Google', 'search'];
const pages = [
  { url: 'https://www.google.com', content: 'Google search is a web search engine.' },
  { url: 'https://www.wikipedia.org', content: 'Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.' },
  { url: 'https://searchengine.com', content: 'Search engines like Google are powerful tools.' }
];



Considerations:

The function must be able to handle pages with different lengths of content.

The keywords must appear in full (i.e., 'search' does not match 'searching') and in any order within the content.

Optimize your code for efficient searching, but prioritize clarity and correctness.

Bonus (optional):
If you have time, add support for a "fuzzy" search, where small spelling differences (for example, "googl" instead of "google") still allow a page to be considered relevant.
