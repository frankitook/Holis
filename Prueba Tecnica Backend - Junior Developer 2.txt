Technical Test Backend - Junior Developer

Description:
Imagine you are working on the Facebook team responsible for the friend search feature. Your task is to develop a function in JavaScript that finds common friends between two users.

Objective:
Implement a function that takes two lists of friends and returns a list of common friends.

Requirements:
1- Inputs: Two arrays of strings representing the friends of two users.

const user1Friends = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'];
const user2Friends = ['Charlie', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Bob'];

2- Output: An array with the names of common friends, without duplicates, sorted alphabetically.



Considerations:

- The use of higher-order functions such as filter, map, or reduce is not allowed (although forEach can be used if necessary).

- The solution should be efficient, considering that the friend lists can be large (up to 10,000 friends per user).

Implementation:
Develop the function findCommonFriends in a file named friendSearch.js.

Submission:
Send the friendSearch.js file with your implementation.
Include a README.md file that explains your solution, any assumptions you made, and how you tested your function.

Evaluation:
Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness and efficiency of the solution.
- Cleanliness and organization of the code.
- Quality of the documentation and clarity of the explanations.
- Ability to handle different test cases.
