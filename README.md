# TECHNICAL TESTS FOR BACKEND DEVELOPERS

This repository contains various technical challenges from companies like Facebook, eBay, and Uber. Each challenge is designed for different positions and levels of experience in backend development, using JavaScript as the primary language (although you can use any other language if you prefer).

# SOLUTIONS

Each technical test has its respective solution implemented in JavaScript. You can review the code and test the solutions yourself to better prepare for technical interviews.

# CONTRIBUTIONS

The main idea of this repository is to help anyone practice before facing a technical test. We want this project to grow and become a useful tool for the entire developer community!

## How to Contribute?

1- Propose New Technical Tests: If you know of technical challenges from other companies or have original ideas, feel free to add them! Make sure to include a clear description of the problem and its solution (if possible).

2- Add Solutions in Other Languages: Although the current solutions are in JavaScript, it would be great to have solutions in other languages like Python, Java, Ruby, etc. Feel free to contribute in your favorite language.

3- Improve Existing Solutions: Do you have an idea to improve any of the current solutions? We welcome optimizations, best practices, or new features.
